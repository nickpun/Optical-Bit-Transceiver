# Optical-Bit-Transceiver
*** Made for a school project. Worked locally, then uploaded to GitHub. This is why there are only 2 commits. ***
 Arduino controlled flashlight to send pulses of light encoded with messages, with a photodiode to receive the messages.
 Encoding messages consists of overlapping multiple frequencies of pulses.
 Decoding messages consists of Fourier Transforming the data to extract the frequencies.
 In comparison with simply using the flashlight as 1/0 for on/off, this method increases the transmission rate significantly.
